# Fitness Club Management System

## Frontend app created for my Capstone Project using Reactjs, Javascript. Should be installed and connected with my Capstone Backend for full stack functionalities.


 A web application frontend that has features that a small fitness gym or similar businesses can utilise, it connects with a backend and consumes the api it offers. 
 
 ### Some feature are:  
                    
    - User authentication            
    - Basic authentication (bcrypt for salt and hash)
    - Customer/Employee management
    - Tasks management system 
    - Contact form that sends emails to the business.
    - Simple and aesthethic UI for easy learning.

## How to run

    - Clone this frontend project to your local.
    - In the project directory, run
     npm install (if there are peer dependecy issues with npm install, you can try npm install --legacy-peer-deps)
     npm start
     your default browser should automatically open to localhost:3000
    - Should be functional as long as the backend server is live on AWS.
    
    - Backend Repository: https://github.com/dvd25/Capstone-Backend if you would like to check out the code.
    - There is no need to connect it manually as backend is hosted on AWS elasticbeanstalk: http://capstonefitnessbackend-env.eba-izrrrwby.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

The app and its functionality should be ready to use.
